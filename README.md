# secretbox

Rust-only implementation of NaCl/Libsodium's secure networking protocol used in multiple network protocols

## `secretbox` vs `sodiumoxide` â€” which to use?
This crate only implements the secretbox algorithm. If you need to use other features from the libsodium library, you currently need to use `sodiumoxide`.

`secretbox` does not contain assembly-level optimization for its cryptographic primitives right now. However its algorithms are fast enough for real-time voice encryption (see below for benchmarks).

`secretbox` is does not use C-bindings which might be hard to build on some systems. Libsodium, the C-library used by `sodiumoxide`, sometimes changes some of its source tarballs, causing build failures.

`secretbox` is not hardened against timing attacks. However it likely does not affect security as the secret that could potentially be leaked is different for every single sealed box.

## Built with

- `uint`
